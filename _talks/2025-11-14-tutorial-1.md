This tutorial explores how spatial omics and H&E histopathology can be integrated using modern machine learning. We highlight recent advances in deep learning—especially graph neural networks and transformers—for aligning molecular and structural tissue data. Key applications and future directions for scalable, interpretable multimodal spatial analysis will be discussed.
